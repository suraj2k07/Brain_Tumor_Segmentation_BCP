**Welcome to Week 2**

In Week 2, we focus on learning the core libraries needed for the project. All students will learn:

Nibabel for loading and working with MRI scans (sample nifti files can be found on sites like OpenNeuro, Kaggle etc)

Basic deep learning concepts (layers, models, training loops)

For the implementation part of the project, you may choose either one of the following frameworks:

Option A: TensorFlow/Keras

or

Option B: PyTorch

You do not need to learn both.
You only need to complete the exercises and build the model in one of the two frameworks, based on your preference.

To support both paths, separate starter notebooks are provided:

tensorflow_keras_basics.ipynb

pytorch_basics.ipynb

Choose the one you wish to continue with for the rest of the project.
